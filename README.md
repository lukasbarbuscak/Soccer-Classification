# Predicting Playing Positions of Soccer Players

## Introduction

This project examines attributes which soccer players need to have in order to play at specific positions on the pitch. Using physical, mental, and technical attributes, as well as variables such as financial information or jersey number, I will build a model that will clasify a player to a position based on the aforementioned features. The dataset used to tackle this problem is the "FIFA 20 complete player dataset" (publicly available at https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/fifa-20-complete-player-dataset). This video game uses real players and uses scouts around the globe to assess players' attributes as accurately as possible.
